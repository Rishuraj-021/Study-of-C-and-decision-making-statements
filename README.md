# Study-of-C-and-decision-making-statements
Aim:C++ decision making statements

Theory:In C++, decision-making statements allow a program to make choices and execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions. These are also called conditional statements and are essential for implementing logic and control flow in programs.


Alogrithm: 1.Algorithm to Check Even or Odd Number:

Start

Declare an integer variable num.

Display a message: "Enter your number:"

Read the value of num from the user.

Check the condition:

If num % 2 == 0:

Display "The number is even."

Else:

Display "The number is odd."

Stop

Algorithm: 2.

Alogorithm to Calculator Using switch:

Start

Declare x, y (integers), choice (character)

Input two numbers â†’ x and y

Show menu:

1) +, 2) -, 3) *, 4) /
   
Input user choice

Use switch(choice):

'1': print x + y

'2': print x - y

'3': print x * y

'4': print x / y

default: print "Wrong choice"

Stop

Algorithm: 3.

Alogorithm for to check Vowel or Consonant:

Start

Declare a character variable c

Ask user to enter a character

Read input into c

Check if c is a vowel:

a, e, i, o, u or A, E, I, O, U

If yes, display "The character is a vowel."

Else, display "The character is a consonant."

Stop

conclusion:C++ decision-making statements help control the logical flow of a program based on conditions, making programs smarter and more interactive.
